# By default flex models, commands, controllers and components are genearated into
# app/flex/<your rails project name> folder. If you'd like to customize the target folder 
# (to say append a "com" package before your rails project name) uncomment the line below
# base-package must follow the usual flex package notation (a string separated by ".")

#base-package: com.pomodo

# Main RestfulX controller is typically named AppicationController. This controller is created in 
# <base-package>.controllers folder. You can customize the name by uncommenting the following line 
# and changing the controller name.

#controller-name: ApplicationController

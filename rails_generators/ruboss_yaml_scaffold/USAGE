Description:
    Scaffolds an entire application based on db/model.yml file. This generator
    transforms entries in db/model.yml into command line calls to 
    "ruboss_scaffold".
    
    ruboss_scaffold delegates the underlying rails code generation to "scaffold"
    and extends it in a number of ways:
      1. Generates all required Flex code.
      2. You can pass special belongs_to, has_one and has_many attributes
         to generate *all* appropriate relationships. No more manual code
         editing.

Examples:
    `./script/generate ruboss_yaml_scaffold`

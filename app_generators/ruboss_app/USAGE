Description:
    Generates the primary Ruboss project directory structure and sets 
    up Flex Builder and TextMate specific descriptor files
    
    You can generate Flex Builder configuration for either *pure* Flex
    project or an AIR project. To generate AIR configuration pass the -a
    (--air) option to the generator.
    
    You can also choose to generate a simple Google App Engine back-end
    along with your Flex front-end by passing the --gae option.

Examples:
    `ruboss-gen pomodo` # generates project structure and a 
                        # default Flex app configuration.
    `ruboss-gen -a pomodo` # as above but generates an AIR app
                           # and configuration
    `ruboss-gen --gae pomodo` # generate Flex + GAE application
                              # configuration
                           
Next Steps:
    In your new Ruboss project folder run `ruby script/generate` for
    a list of available generators.

other right, including the right to enforce asubsequent breach of the same
obligation. In the event that any part of thisAgreement is found to be
unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in effectand such part shall
be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish theobjectives of such
part to the extent permissible by law and consistent with theintent of the
Parties as of the Effective Date. (10. MISCELLANEOUS. This is a license
